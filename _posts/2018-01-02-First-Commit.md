First commit, two years in.

I built the first page of this website back in 2015, and tinkered with it intermittently throughout 2016 and 2017. Finally, in late 2017, I made the most progress in constructing this site. The front page is built with Bootstrap, and the rest of the website, with the exception of the coming portfolio page, is built with a combination of Bootstrap and Jekyll. It should be noted that I am not a web designer by any sort of means, so it is very hard for me to say with confidence that I understand all of the mechanisms that are embedded in the various webpages. I'm sure that there are plenty of bugs, the largest of which is when the main resized. For your convenience, do not resize the main page. Despite all of this, I do know how to program, with proficiency in C/C++, Python, Matlab/Octave, and Lua (with ambivalence) and know the general aspects of the art of programming. Otherwise, obviously, I wouldn't have been able to build this from the ground up, and learn to "blog like a hacker."

As for background on myself, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Yup'ik Eskimo from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in May of 2017. I'm also studying for a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering, something I hope to finish by 2019. Mentioned earlier was my proficiency at programming, something I use to this day at the Alaska Center for Energy and Power, where I work as a research technician/student assistant designing a fuel meter for special types of heaters (something I will describe more in my projects section). I've also used my programming skills in the past to teach high school and middle school students at the Alaska Summer Research Academy from 2012-2015. Teaching, I have found, is something I enjoy to an extent, and have intermittently taught native dance classes and Yup'ik classes at the university since 2014. Writing, however, is something I rarely engage in, although I do have one post at the moment [here](https://redrep.org/2017/09/27/alukesta-we-the-caretakers/). Finally, as hinted above by the portfolio page, I am an amateur photographer since approximately 2014, who specializes in landscapes, although I have been hired several times to take portraits and weddings.

Closing thoughts: this website is still under heavy construction, so don't be surprised if there are changes you see from a day to day basis. The pages that will be going online soon-ish are a project page, portfolio website (it will be external to this website) and possibly a dedicated contact/about page. Perhaps expect to see monthly posts on this blog, maybe bi-monthly on the project pages.

All the best,

Bax
